## What is Konnetto?

Konnetto started from a simple question:  
*What if there was a place that truly understood anime fandom — not just as content, but as a culture?*

At its core, Konnetto lives at the intersection of **anime fandom** and the **creator economy**.  
It brings together community spaces, creator memberships, events, and otaku-friendly tools into a single ecosystem — built specifically for global anime culture and the people who care deeply about it.

Unlike generic creator platforms designed to fit everyone, Konnetto is intentionally focused.  
It’s made for anime fans, creators, and communities who value connection as much as content.

This blog exists to document that journey.

Not just the technical decisions — but also the questions, the doubts, the small wins, and the lessons learned while building something from the ground up. Some posts will dive into architecture and systems. Others will talk about product thinking, community design, or the emotional side of building in public.

Konnetto isn’t being built overnight.  
It’s growing step by step, shaped by curiosity, experimentation, and honest reflection.

This space is a place to slow down, write things out, and make sense of the process — both for ourselves and for anyone curious about how Konnetto is taking shape.
